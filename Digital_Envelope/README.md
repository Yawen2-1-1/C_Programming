# Digtal Envelope
## Description:
An encryption method mixed with a symmetric encrytion and an asymmetric encryption,<br>
which is applied to protect communication packets in an insecure channel.<br><br>
The project is a team work on a course, named "Information Security", in the Program of<br>
Information and Communication Security, and it's an important basic course for the program.

## Algorithms:
  * Symmetric encryption: AES (My responsibility)
  * Asymmetric encryption: RSA

## Advice:
- [ ] Add the salt value to randomize the ciphertext for optimizing the system
Cipertext-only Attack.
