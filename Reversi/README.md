### Description:
A kind of chess games in which both players hold black and white chess respectively.<br>
When the color of the chess is different from the others in its up, down, left, and right directions,<br>
then it will be sacrificed.<br>
The victory depends on which color has the most pieces on the final board.<br>

### Function
Both players are the first mover and the latter mover respectively. And there are four modes in our game.<br>
- Player1 vs. Player2
- Player vs. Computer
- Computer vs. Player
- Computer vs. Computer

### Environment Requirement
There is an interface for designing the chess board, instead of directly using CMD to operate, so a C Language<br>
graphic kit is required. We install WinBGIm Graphics Library in Dev C++.
